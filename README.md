#### Image Resizing Script

This is a simple python script that will generate thumbnails based upon sizes declared in ``IMAGE_SIZES``.  This
is especially helpful in creating icos and pngs for mobile/Cordova applications.

To use you'll need to modify the sizes and file names within the script.  Script should be ran from the same
directory as the image you want to use, or modify the script to use the correct directory.

```python
python resize.py
```
